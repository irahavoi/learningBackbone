  RequireJS implements AMD - asynchronous module definition, which defines a method for writing modular code and managing dependencies. 
	Benefits of RequireJS :
		* Scripts asynchronous loading. (non-blocking loading allows the browser to render the rest of the page while loading scripts)
		* Allows to load modules in more intelligently, having more control over when they are loaded and ensuring that modules with dependencies are loaded in the right order.
