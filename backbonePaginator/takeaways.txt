* Backbone.Paginator supports two main pagination components:
	Backbone.Paginator.requestPager
		For pagination of requests between a client and a server-side API
	Backbone.Paginator.clientPager
		For pagination of data returned from a server that you would like to further paginate
		within the UI (for example, 60 results are returned, paginate into three pages of 20)
