* Each spec is a JavaScript function, described with a call to it() using a description string
and a function. The description should describe the behavior the particular unit of code
should exhibit and, keeping in mind BDD, should ideally be meaningful. Here’s an
example of a basic spec:
  it('should be incrementing in value', function(){
    var counter = 0;
    counter++;
    expect(counter).toEqual(1);
  });
You define expectations in specs using the expect() function and an expectation
matcher—for example, toEqual(), toBeTruthy(), toContain().

* Specs are grouped into suites that we describe using Jasmine’s describe() function,
again passing a string as a description and a function as we did for it(). The name/
description for your suite is typically that of the component or module you’re testing.

Jasmine will use the description as the group name when it reports the results of the
specs you’ve asked it to run. A simple suite containing our sample spec could look like:
describe('Stats', function(){
    it('can increment a number', function(){
    ...
  });

  it('can subtract a number', function(){
    ...
  });
});
