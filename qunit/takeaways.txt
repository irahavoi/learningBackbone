* QUnit is a powerful JavaScript test suite written by jQuery team member Jörn Zaefferer
and used by many large open source projects (such as jQuery and Backbone.js) to
test their code. It’s capable of testing both standard JavaScript code in the browser and
code on the server side (where supported environments include Rhino, V8, and
SpiderMonkey).


* Basic assertions:
ok ( state, message )
Passes if the first argument is truthy

equal ( actual, expected, message )
A simple comparison assertion with type coercion

notEqual ( actual, expected, message )
The opposite of equal()

expect( amount )
The number of assertions expected to run within each test

strictEqual( actual, expected, message)
Offers a much stricter comparison than equal() and is considered the preferred
method of checking equality, as it avoids stumbling on subtle coercion bugs

deepEqual( actual, expected, message )
Similar to strictEqual, comparing the contents (with ===) of the given objects,
arrays, and primitives

* Tests can be organized in modules:
module( 'Module One' );
test( 'first test', function() {} );
test( 'another test', function() {} );
module( 'Module Two' );
test( 'second test', function() {} );
test( 'another test', function() {} );
module( 'Module Three' );
test( 'third test', function() {} );
test( 'another test', function() {} );


*Use setup and teardown functions for initializing your modules and cleaning them up.
