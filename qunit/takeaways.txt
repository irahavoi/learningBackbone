* QUnit is a powerful JavaScript test suite written by jQuery team member Jörn Zaefferer
and used by many large open source projects (such as jQuery and Backbone.js) to
test their code. It’s capable of testing both standard JavaScript code in the browser and
code on the server side (where supported environments include Rhino, V8, and
SpiderMonkey).
